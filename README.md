# HR-Dqshboard
Hello everyone ğŸ‘‹
I am happy to share my new HR Dashboard built with Power BI.
 In this project, I used Power Query for data cleaning and added conditional columns for more accurate analysis:
 ğŸ”¹Salary Group
 ğŸ”¹Years of Work
 ğŸ”¹ Work state 
Here are the key insights from the dashboard:
ğŸ”¹ Average Salary: 72.48K
 ğŸ”¹ Total Employees: 276
 ğŸ”¹ Hiring Trend: Highest in 2019, lowest in 2021
 ğŸ”¹ Work State: Majority of employees are full-time
 ğŸ”¹ Salary Groups: Most employees earn between 50Kâ€“100K, least earn more than 100K
 ğŸ”¹ Employment Type: ~66% of employees are permanent
 ğŸ”¹ Work Location: Most employees work remotely
ğŸ“Š This dashboard helps HR teams better understand workforce distribution and salary structures to support decision-making.
âœ¨ Looking forward to your feedback and suggestions!
